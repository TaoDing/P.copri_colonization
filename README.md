### Processiong Data:

Figure 1. LEfSe analysis showed that Prevotella and Bacteroides enriched in the healthy populations of TAR and GD, respectively.

Figure 2. P. copri dominated the symbiotic community and maintained a continuous colonization advantage in a 2-year cohort.

Figure 3. Establishment of P. copri's colonization advantage in the human population was accompanied by a reduction in B. ovatus.

Figure 4. The competition between P. copri and Bacteroides spp. was due to a common requirement for multiple substrates.

Figure 5. P. copri gained colonization advantages through metabolic regulation to inhibit the expansion of commensal bacteria (especially to Bacteroides spp.).

Figure 6. P. copri's competitive advantage was linked to associated with nucleotide energy substances synthesis.

Figure 7. P. copri harbored a stronger ability to synthesize ATP than B. ovatus and
was capable of metabolizing 2'-deoxyadenosine under the impetus of ATP, promoting its growth in case of nutrient limitation.

Figure 8. P. copri clade A gradually became the dominant clade during host migration.
