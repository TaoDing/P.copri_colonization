## Prevotella copri secures privileged intestinal colonization by the assistance of deoxyadenosine kinase-mediated DNA salvage synthesis 

### Context:

bash: bash scripts used to reproduce all tables that would be used for downstream R analysis.

R.code: R scripts used to reproduce all statistical results and visualized pictures.

Source Data: Including species feature table, subject's metadata, and results of in vitro culture experiments.

Supplementary tables: Supplementary tables in the article.


### Processiong Data:


Figure 1. P. copri dominated the gut microbiota and maintained a continuous colonization.

Figure 2. Colonization of P. copri in population was accompanied by a reduction in B. ovatus. 

Figure 3. The competition between P. copri and Bacteroides spp. was due to a common requirement for multiple substrates.

Figure 4. Supernatant feeding experiments showed that P. copri could utilize the metabolites of Bacteroides and regulate the growth of commensal bacteria.

Figure 5.P. copri was superior to B. ovatus in nucleotide metabolism to synthesize ATP.

Figure 6. P. copri metabolized 2'-deoxyadenosine via dak enzyme to support growth in auxotrophic condition.

Figure 7. High prevalence of dak on P. copri Clade A promoted its emergence as the dominant subspecies.
