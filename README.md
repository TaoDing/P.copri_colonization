# S.copri_colonization


## Segatella copri Exploits Bacteroides-derived vesicles for Intestinal Colonization via a dual competitive-exploitative strategy

### Context:

bash: bash scripts used to reproduce all tables that would be used for downstream R analysis.

R.code: R scripts used to reproduce all statistical results and visualized pictures.


Supplementary tables: Supplementary tables in the article.


### Processiong Data:


Figure 1. S. copri maintained stable colonization in the gut despite changes in the hostâ€™s diet..

Figure 2. S. copri could compete with B. ovatus for utilization of multiple substrates and were superior to the latter in ATP synthesis.

Figure 3. Supernatant feeding experiments revealed that the growth of S. copri could be promoted by B. ovatus supernatant.

Figure 4. The supplementation of the supernatant of B. ovatus culture significantly promotes S. copri colonization in the gut of antibiotic pre-treated mice. 

Figure 5.The outer membrane vesicles of B. ovatus significantly promoted the growth of S. copri. 

Figure 6. The OMVs of B. ovatus significantly promoted the S. copri colonization in the gut of antibiotic pre-treated mice.
