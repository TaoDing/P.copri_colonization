## Prevotella copri Exploits Metabolic Synergies with Bacteroides for Intestinal Colonization

### Context:

bash: bash scripts used to reproduce all tables that would be used for downstream R analysis.

R.code: R scripts used to reproduce all statistical results and visualized pictures.

Source Data: Including species feature table, subject's metadata, and results of in vitro culture experiments.

Supplementary tables: Supplementary tables in the article.


### Processiong Data:


Figure 1. P. copri dominated the gut microbiota and maintained a continuous colonization.

Figure 2. Colonization of P. copri in population was accompanied by a reduction in B. ovatus. 

Figure 3. Supernatant feeding experiments showed that P. copri could utilize the metabolites of Bacteroides and regulate the growth of commensal bacteria.

Figure 4. Mice co-colonization experiments showed that the colonization of P. copri was promoted by B. ovatus metabolites to obtain more carbohydrates.

Figure 5.P. copri was superior to B. ovatus in nucleotide metabolism to synthesize ATP.

Figure 6. P. copri metabolized 2'-deoxyadenosine via dak enzyme to support growth in auxotrophic condition.

Figure 7. High prevalence of dak on P. copri Clade A promoted its emergence as the dominant subspecies.
