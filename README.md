# P.copri_colonization


## Deoxyadenosine kinase-mediated DNA salvage synthesis assists Prevotella copri to secure privileged intestinal colonization

Context:

R.code: R scripts used to reproduce all statistical results and visualized pictures.

Source Data: Including species feature table and subject's metadata.

Processiong Data:

Figure 1. Prevalence of gut Prevotella copri significantly correlated with TIV-specific antibody production.

Figure 2. Multi-omics analysis revealed that gut P. copri and A. megaguti-associated L-lysine metabolism strengthened the TIV vaccination response.

Figure 3. Influenza vaccination has a greater impact on the URT microbiota than the gut microbiota.

Figure 4. URT microbes are enriched in the gut and interact with the gut microbiota.

Figure 5. TIV vaccination is associated with an increase in Streptococcus and loss of some species in the URT.

Figure 6. TIV vaccination reshapes the URT microbiota, affecting functional gene expression.
